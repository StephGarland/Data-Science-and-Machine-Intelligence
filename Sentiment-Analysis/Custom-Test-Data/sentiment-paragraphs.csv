"Privileged from birth, it was during the Vietnam War period, Trump discovered he could avoid difficult times and hard work. His cocoon of wealth lacked checks and balances and enabled Donald Trump to believe himself both smarter and better looking than anyone else. At first making pronouncements based upon excellent education, and then as school grew more distant and Trump more coddled, Donald Trump realized that, almost universally, his pronouncements on any subject was met with instant approval and praise. Donald J. Trump was always right. Ask his friends."	0
"Donald Trump’s presidency has been every bit as amateurish and chaotic and ridiculous as his campaign was. As time has elapsed many of those who were terrified at first have come to view the president as a clown who is in way over his head. Utter uncertainty prevailed during the months between Trump’s election in November and his January inauguration, and many were genuinely concerned that Trump would quickly become a tyrant once in office, using the power of the presidency to go after his enemies and silence his critics."	0
"Billionaire businessman Bill Gates just made good on his reputation as a one of the most generous philanthropists. Gates, the world’s richest man, donated $4.6 billion worth of shares in Microsoft Corp in June — making this his largest donation in 17 years. Gates donated 64 million shares earlier this summer, according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing released Monday and first shared by Bloomberg."	1
"The Beatles are four British ISIS members accused of torture, mock execution and decapitation of foreign hostages, including three Americans — journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and American aid worker Peter Kassig. Hence, the United States has a keen interest in seeking justice, but so do others.  "	0
"“This is truly a magic bullet for our patients with TRK-positive cancer,” said Leo Mascarenhas M.D, M.S, deputy director of the Children’s Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases and director of the Names Family Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Program in oncology at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, who helped design the pediatric part of the study. “In some cases, this cancer can be treated surgically – often requiring amputation or another disfiguring surgical procedure. After treating our patient with infantile fibrosarcoma with larotrectinib, the cancer shrunk sufficiently and we were able to surgically remove the tumor while preserving the patient’s leg.”"	1
MPs are about to vote to put the tertiary education bill into law with the changes that we all told them to make. This is fantastic news! We knew communities would lose out if future governments could freely move public funds into profit-driven tertiary institutions - and we stopped it happening. This is really significant. We spoke out and together we have changed the future of public tertiary education. 	1
"Actors and athletes increasingly using their forums for political activism are turning off viewers, according to a newly released poll. A McLaughlin & Associates/Media Research Center survey released Wednesday found that 44 percent were less likely to watch sports and entertainment shows “because they have become too political.”  In addition, 75 percent said they watch sports and entertainment to escape from politics, and “do not want to be bombarded with partisan political messages.” The poll of 1,000 likely voters comes with television ratings plummeting in the last year for high-profile sports and entertainment events. The NFL regular season ratings dropped by 9.7 percent in 2017 amid player protests during the national anthem, while the 2018 Academy Awards show suffered its worst-ever audience ratings, falling by 19 percent from 2017.

"Hillary Clinton has not had a good week. In the aftermath of her trip to India and awful comments about Americans and women in particular, most of her allies and Democrats in general were explicit that it was time for her to leave the political arena. The shorter message from Democrats to Mrs. Clinton was “shut up and go away.” But she has not. Instead, she took to Facebook and doubled-down on her smear of Americans who didn’t vote for her as racist and mindless."	0
"What are the media and political elite smoking these days? They actually appear to believe that Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s Eton-educated chief executive, who has been suspended, is a Bond-type villain behind the scenes, whose data company has the power to change the world. They also appear to believe the self-serving claims made by the pink-haired data science geek and whistleblower at the heart of the exposé, Christopher Wylie, that he became ‘Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool’, which brought Trump to power. This is deeply delusional."	0
"Afua Hirsch, quite unintentionally, has provided us with a searing insight into the 21st-century politics of identity. Her narcissistic study of her personal identity – Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging – is intended to be a memoir-cum-treatise on what it’s like to be black and of African origin in Britain in the early part of the millennium. But it works far better as a glimpse, an often terrifying glimpse, into the myopia and backwardness and insatiable appetite for victim status that motors the identitarianism that is now the dominant ideology of the bourgeoisie. This book documenting a well-educated woman’s descent into the self-obsessive and self-victimising cult of identitarian thinking should serve as a warning to everyone to reject this politics."	0
"Jordan Peterson appears very profound and has convinced many people to take him seriously. Yet he has almost nothing of value to say. This should be obvious to anyone who has spent even a few moments critically examining his writings and speeches, which are comically befuddled, pompous, and ignorant. They are half nonsense, half banality. In a reasonable world, Peterson would be seen as the kind of tedious crackpot that one hopes not to get seated next to on a train."	0
"This much should be obvious from even a cursory reading of him: If Jordan Peterson is the most influential intellectual in the Western world, the Western world has lost its damn mind. And since Jordan Peterson does indeed have a good claim to being the most influential intellectual in the Western world, we need to think seriously about what has gone wrong. What have we done to end up with this man? His success is our failure, and while it’s easy to scoff at him, it’s more important to inquire into how we got to this point. He is a symptom. He shows a culture bereft of ideas, a politics without inspiration or principle. Jordan Peterson may not be the intellectual we want. But he is probably the intellectual we deserve."	0
President Obama made history as the first minority to be elected president. Even many who opposed his election felt proud of our country as he took the oath of office. We are honored today to have the man currently holding the office and aspiring for another term.	1
"Obama recalled the late Senator Ted Kennedy telling him about the times when he would stroll the halls of the cancer ward when his son Teddy, Jr. was being treated more than forty years ago. While the elder Kennedy did not worry about paying for his son’s treatment, this was not the case for so many other parents of children in the cancer ward. Parents did not complain; they simply did their best for their children. Courage requires endurance. And their courage inspired Ted Kennedy to devote his energies toward providing affordable health care."	1
"Nuclear energy has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future. Nuclear energy is both expensive and dangerous, and just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean. Renewable energy is better for the environment, the economy, and doesn’t come with the risk of a nuclear meltdown."	0
"The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) urges doctors to prescribe non-GMO diets for all patients. They cite animal studies showing organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, and infertility. Human studies show how genetically modified (GM) food can leave material behind inside us, possibly causing long-term problems. Genes inserted into GM soy, for example, can transfer into the DNA of bacteria living inside us, and that the toxic insecticide produced by GM corn was found in the blood of pregnant women and their unborn fetuses."	0
Communism kills! This is not debatable. The record is crystal clear. The U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee conducted investigations into the number killed in the Soviet Union and China. Their report stated that 35 million to 45 million had been killed in the Soviet Union and 34 million to 62.5 million in Communist China.	0
"That said, following a vegetarian diet can be nutritionally superior to any other way of eating says Tallmadge. It can be one of the healthiest ways to eat, because we know plant foods are loaded with nutrients to protect our health.”"	1
"Gareth Bale appeared in the press room at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium. After the screening of a video with his best moments as a Real Madrid player, the Welsh striker welcomed the extension of his contract until 30 June 2022: ""I am very very happy, delighted. When I arrived I wanted to be successful and win titles. It's another dream come true and I hope there are more titles and trophies. I have improved my Spanish, my family is more integrated and I feel that the fans love me"""	1
"By that, I mean a working assumption that the solution to the crises of climate change and rising demand for energy (and the consequent upward spiral in energy prices) can be found, relatively quickly, in technological innovation. Regarding energy, that means taking the affirmative steps to maximize the immense energy sources that we know are available right now. Regarding climate, that means exploring and endorsing the various geo-engineering solutions to climate change."	1
"Nothing else can produce the joy or broken heart that motherhood allows. I couldn't imagine going through life without feeling that spectrum of emotion. There are wonderful days when I feel my cup runneth over. There are days that I want to run away and question every decision I have ever made. Feeling it all, good or bad, gives my life purpose. Motherhood is walking around with all of your nerve endings raw and exposed. It is the most extreme measure of being alive"	1
"Oncoming death is terrible enough, but worse still is oncoming death with time to spare, time in which all the happiness that was yours and all the happiness that might have been yours becomes clear to you. You see with utter lucidity all that you are losing"	0
"People you meet while on the road become some of the most valued names on your contact list. They become places on the map to visit later on. These folks give you a glimpse outside your hometown circle of friends, and force you to take in new and refreshing perspectives, and ultimately realize that everyone is the same."	1
"As Barack Obama's presidency winds down, Americans are feeling more than a little melancholy about the first black family leaving the White House. President Obama's soaring popularity over the last few months saw him play one of Hillary Clinton's most powerful surrogates during the election, but the one person who enjoyed even wider adoration, both on the campaign trail and off, was First Lady Michelle Obama."	1
"Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn. Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key."	1
"The chance to specialise: If you have a passionate love for history, you dream of a career as a barrister or you are a budding Stephen Hawking, University is an ideal place to encounter great thinkers. If you are lucky enough to encounter lecturer and tutors who are as passionate about your field as you are, it can be intensely rewarding. Your Professors will accompany you along the most important areas of your subject provide important reading lists and keep you abreast of new developments in your chosen subject. It is no wonder that most graduates look back on their University days as the most mentally stimulating of their life."	1
"Social media can be used to educate young people. While talking to and advising kids and teens on a one-on-one basis is considered ideal, social media can do the same much more effectively and to a broader audience all at once. People like to use YouTube to express their opinions on various subjects. In the process, they attract millions of views and climb to the top of search engines. This leads to companies taking an interest in sponsorship and furnishing of better gear to make better videos while showcasing their product. Social media can be used as a voice of reason in society. Various social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are being used by the youth to create a voice for the voiceless. On Facebook, for example, groups like “Disability is not inability” are being brought up to make society more conscious of how they treat the disabled. Most of these groups are started by young people who see the essence of treating everyone equally and social media as the perfect place to spread that message."	1
"Consider instead some of the promising futures that AI could enable. AI has the potential to radically transform, in a positive way, the degree to which we can utilize and process data and information in ways that people simply cannot. In addition, simple everyday actions, such as interacting with the Internet of Things, that have become overly complex because of arcane interfaces (e.g., setting a thermostat or controlling a TV) can be radically simplified through natural language. As AI systems mature, they will drive important advancements for society, in areas like healthcare, education, the economy and many more. An AI system could help a doctor with a diagnosis, serve as a virtual teacher with the wealth of Internet knowledge at its fingertips, or be woven into the fabric of our daily lives, helping us with everything from basic decision-making to driving our cars."	1
" AI has drawn some rather extreme headlines recently, as the conversation has shifted from the progress that we are seeing to a feared end result – AI-based technology surpassing the levels of intelligence of humans and posing a threat to our existence. Apart from the popularity of such doomsday scenarios in science fiction, this outlook appears unfounded: there is currently no evidence to suggest that anything like this would necessarily happen. Perhaps even more importantly, we’re getting rather ahead of ourselves with these sorts of predictions. AI has indeed seen some encouraging and impressive progress over the last few years, but we still have a long way to go before we achieve anything capable of the scenarios that have been discussed."	0
"Globalisation operates mostly in the interests of the richest countries, which continue to dominate world trade at the expense of developing countries. The role of LEDCs in the world market is mostly to provide the North and West with cheap labour and raw materials.Globalisation operates mostly in the interests of the richest countries, which continue to dominate world trade at the expense of developing countries. The role of LEDCs in the world market is mostly to provide the North and West with cheap labour and raw materials. Globalisation is viewed by many as a threat to the world's cultural diversity. It is feared it might drown out local economies, traditions and languages and simply re-cast the whole world in the mould of the capitalist North and West. An example of this is that a Hollywood film is far more likely to be successful worldwide than one made in India or China, which also have thriving film industries. "	0
"I appreciate Rothfuss' struggle. And he's human, just like us. I guess I've learned to enjoy his mental wanderings as a part of who he is. It's not necessarily what we came for, but it's part of what adds up to the stories he's written so far. I wish people weren't so hard on him for this.?"	1
Feels really hypocritical to me. Towards the end he talks about if it's okay to have a TV series (Netflix's Punisher) about a compelling character who decides who has to die because they are bad and then goes and kills them. At the same time his book's main characters goes and does the same at several occasions. He's also very preachy in general but this time he's especially higher than thou. I don't think the guy shouting in the question about D3 at the beginning didn't help much by getting him into the preachy mindset.?	0
"I got interested on crochet because on one of my classes we had an option to do many things such as crochet, embroidery, knitting, loom etc. and I picked embroidery, but once my friend finished, (she did crochet) she had a beautiful green hat with mike from monsters inc and it looked adorable! And I wanted to do that! So I hope I can be as talented as her!?"	1
Too much talking and repeat explanations make it harder to follow because we get frustrated waiting for all the talking to see the step unfold so we can actually try it!! Please can u make these same video tutorials but at a much quicker pace for those of us who learn at a quick pace and rather have more doing to learn then listening to repeat explanations to learn. It would be greatly appreciated because i like your videos but i had to stop and search others as i found myself getting frustrated waiting so long just to learn & try the technique.	0
I'm so grateful for videos like yours! Vegan is so gentle and gentle is totally metaphysical. This does help all kinds of disadvantaged people and I know videos like these are helping us to get connected because on my budget...this is the only way to find this stuff! Universal Cheers!	1
Have never felt better in my life. Went from having high cholesterol with risk of needing an artery bypass surgery at 200lb to 135lbs with barely any cholesterol & being the healthiest I’ve ever been in my life. All achieved with eating plant based & exercising every day! I’ve never been happier than I am now! I wish I would have become Vegan sooner but I’m glad to have finally opened my eyes along with my mind.	1
Failed veganism many times. Found pescitarianism and it changed my life. I don't eat dairy either. I do it 90% for health reasons. Fish is way more healthier than livestock and actually adds to your health not diminishes it. I feel fantastic. My skin and hair is better. I love it. There r fish that have Mercury so I stay away from those higher in Mercury is say I'm a Pescitarian/Vegan/Raw Vegan lol sometimes I eat vegan sometimes I add fish but I love it!!! In never eating livestock again!?	1
"It's a shame you're so young, or I would hunt you down and MARRY YOU!  I think you're an extremely beautiful woman and very well spoken!  I became a PESCETARIAN about (8) months ago.  The reason actually was because I had a serious GOUT ATTACK  for the second time in (8)yrs.  And no one knows what kind of pain gout can give you but it's horrible.  So I did a lot of research and found that it comes from an excessive amount of eating red meat, poultry and shell fish.  (something called PURINES in the meat).    Now ,  I love my SEA FOOD and SHELL FISH."	1
Do vegans care about billions of insects being sprayed with insecticides on the fields used to grow their soy? Do they care about field rats and moles being torn to shreds by farming equipment? Do they care about even more rodents and insects being killed during the storing stage? Our livestock is no longer that wild animal we first domesticated thousands of years ago. After countless of generations of selective breeding they are biological machines designed by humans to provide them with nutrients. If you release our farm animals back into the wild they will not be able to readapt and will simply go extinct.?	0
"Shitty clickbait video. I was vegetarian for a year. Felt like shit. Started eating meat again. Feel better than ever. Don't get me wrong I learned a lot from being vegetarian and about how to cook veggies etc. I just think a mixed diet is the best for your health. I also don't think I am a bad person for eating meat. Don't act like agriculture is in any way ""moral"". Wiping out entire eco systems to plant one crop on that land is neither moral nor good for the environment. I'd say eating wild caught fish or game meat or eggs from free-roaming chicken is more moral than eating agricultural foods. People are acting like they are so educated because they watched a few vegan propaganda documentaries, but they really have no idea about how food production works nor anything about ecology or human ancestry.?"	0
"That nasal thing is bullocks! I have nasal polyps. Bloody annoying things makes breathing a bitch both left and right constantly! They're either blocked or runny... Yet Ive passed exams and can play guitar, function the same at work and debate charlatans on facebook.?"	0
"To be honest it sounds like Nino has had some kind of long-term alcohol/mental health problems, has been in rehab, and should never have been put in charge - he's just super stressed, and lies all the time to cover it up. I get why his family is so frustrated (he is NOT good at running the place), but they should've just let him go and encouraged him to find a different job.?"	0
"I've never really cared what people think of me. I'm more worried about what my loved ones think of me. I just live a good life, full of honesty and integrity."	1
"The over-friendly also practices over-closeness; acting as though they have a relationship with us, one that would explain their exuberance at seeing us. I personally can't deal with over-friendlies because they act too casually with me whilst I don't actually know them. We're not close enough to have a conversation, or such an exuberant one at that.?"	0
"I guess I'm not over friendly because I disagree with this video. I think it's a little too trivial to decide if someone is capable of a deep friendship based on what they compliment you on. I compliment people on what I sincerely believe deserves compliment. The compliments that are insincere are the ones people say just to please the person they're talking to. Also it's dumb to think that when you meet a person you should try to feel their pain. Like I prefer to just act like myself, hope the other person acts like themself and see if our personalities are compatible."	0
"As one of these so called ""good children"" I just want to say that you have made a complete over-generalization. I am the complete opposite of my parents and I rebelled but in the opposite way most people think. I know how to behave because I'm a decent person. I 'rebelled' by deciding I didn't believe in the same things my parents do and because of it, I'm seen as a bad child by them."	0
"What I get from my list is that I should be a writer. Specifically in non-fiction. I really like non-fiction writing because it helps explain to people information, communicating ideas in a digestible and insightful-sounding manner. Good writing helps people with their problems. I like whenever I do something that makes people happy, and I also like getting praised for my writing. I like completing goals I set for myself, such as in a video game, rather than those imposed on me by someone else. I like completing tasks I chose to take on in everyday life, like walking the dog or doing the dishes. So that's related to what a writer does; set tasks and goals for themselves, and then accomplishes them.?"	1
Why people really travel: They have too much money to blow and they're bored of being at home. Then they return after spending a week in some tourist spot and act like they've become enlightened by their time in a Disney resort and bore everyone with crappy pictures.?	0
"I find travel to be a very egoistical institution. Mostly, it is for people to expand their curriculum of life and confirm out of narcissistic desire that they ""achieved"" something tangible. To add to the superficiality of it all, we attach to the word a very consumerist definition; in order for one to legitimately say he did travel one has to go outside a preconceived border that others can relate to. I could argue walking down two blocks from my house is travelling, even if it's a path I've taken before. Of course, this would sound silly because to the majority of us travelling means going out on a trip using certain means of transportation or moving across national/geographical frontiers. We're being sold the idea that travel is only something you can buy yourself through planes and hotels."	0
"This is horrible advice. There is hardly ever a need to be brutal when breaking up with some one. Especially if the other person has never done wrong by you. Have some empathy, go and chat to them. Tell them how your feeling and be honest, sure. If it drags out, then use more direct and assertive language. But every one should practice compassion in the beginning. I would hope you at least think that perhaps you owe to the other person who you shared so much with. And for the sake of humanity, dont ever break up with some one you have spent more than a couple of months with via a text message. Thats just rude.?"	0
If Severe Weather Events continue to cost billions then how long will it take before the costs cripples countries. These are the Questions and the problems that we all need to face now in 2018 that should have been sorted in 1970 or before. Greed and status has blind sided the entire world’s population. What happens when the majority find out the minority’s have made this Beautiful Planet inhabitable in there life time? Hold on to your hat.?	0
He’s got a real simple way of viewing things and looks at the world like his community. He’s acting out on these huge ideas because he just wants to help. Wild. The perfect timeline of both nature and nurture has shaped him to who he is. I respect this guy. Maybe I’ll bring him a few ideas hehe	1
"I would work for Elon Musk in a second. His goals are so steep and noble that they are worth going for, even in the full possibility of failure. Man is the most determined and hardest working CEO i have EVER seen and that is in short supply in the corporate world.?"	1
"When I first saw Kumail's stand up I thought he was hilarious especially about the drug ""cheese"". And I went to go look up more of his stand ups but I kept noticing that he said that joke in just about all his stand ups. I slowly started to like him less kinda sad "	0
"Handler is jarring in her prejudice, here. She caught him off guard, too, though he tried to be pleasant. She treated him like he was an alien from outer space, or an entirely different species. There are so many interviews where women are asked ignorant and patronizing questions by male interviewers, which is benevolent sexism. Handler asks questions here that are saturated with benevolent racism. This is an icky interview, especially the opening questions and that closing comment about how she'd ""try"" a Pakistani--as if men from Pakistan are alien creatures. It has a similar sliminess to sexual harassment. (Racial harassment?)?"	0
"I love how female comedians instantly alienate half the audience by saying ""hello ladies...!"" at the beginning of their sets! It's their way of saying, us females are now going to gang up on you in a double standards sexist rant against men, but then I will happily spend your money, but still complain about how males, weirdly, don't find female comedians funny."	0
"After all those sleepless nights, I still know this poem by heart and it still gives me chills. But I can sleep again and I'm not afraid of living anymore. There is hope for you, reading this. I hope you'll hang on. Things get better?."	1
"When I say thank you, I mean I adore you, and when I say I adore you, I mean I will check your horoscope. 
I mean when you leave the balloons that you carry in your laughter behind on my ceiling, well I like them better than flowers.
My body is a garden rooted in gratitude. Thank you is the biggest poem I've got inside of me.
Me? I am a campfire cold hearts like to sit around and roast their marshmallows in,
but when I say campfire I mean tiny furnace,
little light lady, I mean I am NOT the path of least resistance,
but I swear I was struck by lightning. Bang! Boom! Wow!"	1
"This was a beautiful piece. I loved the creativity with which she wrote this one. Every line came together to create something epic. ""the saddest word you know is my name."" DAMN what an amazing line. This really got to me. Well done.?"	1
"Ashley Judd did a good job at the rally of course, but THIS is authentic. I feel so much more when hearing the author perform it herself. I'm so glad we have access to this performance. Nina, thank you so much for sharing your talent, your passion, your soul. We need this now just as much as we ever did. Never stop. You are going to inspire so many people to the work we must do. We need your voice. Please continue the work."	1
"You made me cry although we just met.You are a brilliant young poet with an incredible future, regardless of the obstacles that will be put in your way.I would love to have the words to your beautiful poem to translate to Spanish to show them to my beautiful wife and other latin women.Congratulations on your powerful words and your brilliant mind.?"	1

"Queen Elizabeth is not happy. Even if she is saying for the cameras she is happy, it's a lie. Which white grandmother is happy when your grandson marries an older, divorced and half black girl? And that too in the Royal Family. That family have never seen anything like this. Harry could have hand picked any girl in the world and she would say yes. Why her??"	0
"I'm really happy that instead of, what Trevor did in the beginning, ridicule her and use the audience that is already on his side in his advantage to put her down, he started to listen and truly react to her answers and questions. Also I think it is great that she came onto the show.?"	1
"I am so tired of the black folks who support the black lives matter movement. That they can not see that it only leads to more chaos and misery. This has gone as far as chaos with feminists. Every time someone says something someone else does not like about black lives, then you are racist. Nothing good comes out hate, start to respect each other instead. If everybody begins to take their own responsibility. and we end up killing each other before we blame others then perhaps humanity has a chance."	0
"Ever since i started meditating, my life has been turning around for the good. i feel a scenes of joy, peace and happiness. The things I need the most in my life. I was so socially awkward, and because of that I had no friends. Mediation has taught me how to face those fears. with out those fears i started to be more socially active. Strangers would become friends, and with friends came happiness."	1
"You are so sweet to address your fans directly.  I know it must have been terrifying, but as a family member of other survivors and as a physician, I can reassure you that your prognosis is absolutely excellent.  I send you great love and wishes for a speedy and uncomplicated recovery.  And I'm so pleased you are feeling happy to be alive!"	1
"You're a personal hero of mine as you are, no doubt, to a great many others. I have long hoped to one day have the honor of meeting you and shaking your hand and expressing how much I appreciate your incredible demeanor, powerful eloquence, sharp wit, cool charm, great character, massive intelligence, and really your overall existence. Though surely even this would barely qualify as scratching the surface of who you are as a man."	1
"I most certainly don't want to be mean, but quite frankly this pompous gay old fruit has spent all his very miserable life running all over planet mudball being a deliberately blasphemous nasty person, the rules for all, regarding such anti social behavior are as follows, without exception.....  if you try to stick one up the creators clacker and mock etc, He will return the favor.  everyone is going to eventually die sometime, it's unavoidable, the very least one could do is try to be nice toward others impartially during the journey.?"	0
"One mans treasure is another mans junk. How true that is. Many items i see people collect are completely worthless to me. Some items are so ugly and wore out, it's astonishing to hear the appraisal. This is especially true of art work. Hideous paintings in awful frames getting tens of thousands, even millions. To me, many are so bad, i wouldn't give $50."	0
