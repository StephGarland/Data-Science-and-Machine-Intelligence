# Data-Science-and-Machine-Intelligence

In 2017 I completed the **Data Science and Machine Intelligence paper** at Otago Polytechnic taught by David Rozado. This was an introduction and overview of a range of Machine learning techniques with an emphasis on the intuition and the applications behind the concepts. Included were units on Machine Vision, Natural Language Processing, Signal Processing, and using IBM Watson services. The assignments were a good representation of the course content covered, and can be found here: [DSMI Assignments](https://github.com/StephGarland/Data-Science-and-Machine-Intelligence/tree/master/DSMI-Paper-Otago-Polytechnic).

In August 2017 I began my capstone project in **Machine Intelligence - Natural Language Processing.** This was a year long project aimed at furthering my understanding of Machine Intelligence techniques and processes. 
The first semester focused on **web-scraping** with the aim of turning unstructured data (text) from 50 of the top univerisities in the US into word vectors which could then be used for comparison and further analysis. 
- An example of a spider used in this project can be found here: [Yale: Text Extraction - No depth limits](https://github.com/StephGarland/Data-Science-and-Machine-Intelligence/tree/master/Data-Extraction). 
- The corpus analysis was performed by a project colleague, and a demonstration of his work can be found here: [Thom Blackford-Paine's NLP Demo](http://nlp.op-bit.nz/).

The second semester (in early 2018) focused on **Sentiment Analysis**. This focal point was used to further my understanding of building neural networks, and exploring the impacts different components had on the accuracy of a model. I began with using fully connected feed-forward networks and one-hot encoding, and throughout the semester trialled models with word-embeddings, RNNs, and LTSM units. The main documentation was in the form of a overview for beginners, and can be found here: [Sentiment Analysis Overview](https://github.com/StephGarland/Data-Science-and-Machine-Intelligence/blob/master/Sentiment-Analysis/Sentiment%20Analysis%20Overview%20-%202018%2C%20Semester%201.ipynb).
